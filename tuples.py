#Tuples are similar to list. SO we can use them to store a list of items. But unlike list we can't modify them, we can't remove existing items.

#Tuples are immutable. We can't mutate or change to them

num=[3,4,10,3,4,1,4] #use square brackets for list
tuples=(1,2,3) #use parenthesis for list
#tuples has mainly 'count' & 'index' method
print(tuples)
#tuples[0]=23--get error here as tuples doest not support assignment

#If no modification will be done in list of your program then its better to use tuples
